						<h3>Why Wearables?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>When talking about “wearables” we instantly think of smart watches, wristbands and google glasses. Altogether they painted a perfect future for us, where everything is smart, sleek, and efficient. This singular future picture somehow creates aesthetic fatigue, making us question if there can be other variations to the story.</p>

<p>When can we treat wearables just like the other “wearables” in our life? We don’t wear the same clothes everyday, so maybe it doesn’t make sense to design “a killer wearable” that will work perfectly under every circumstance. </p>

<p>In Alternative Wearables - A Design Fiction, we explored five concepts / scenarios for future wearables. It’s not about proposing what wearables will do in the future, or at least not just about that. We want to call attention to what a wearable is, what it can be, our relationship with it, and its social implications.

						<h3><span>No 1.</span> "Dumb" is the new black.</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Everything is becoming smart, and smarter. The internet of things has formed an invisible web over our life, tracking and monitoring everything we say, do, and even think. This ever-connectedness brings convenience but also put our privacy at risk before we even know it.</p>
					<p>Ever miss the old days when things are dumber? No.1 “dumbifies” all smart devices within 3 feet around you and brings you a moment of isolation. No concerns of being tracked and no incoming notifications from your attention-grabbing smart devices. Enjoy your “offline” time, until you’re ready to go “online” again.</p>

						<h3><span>No 2.</span> Be aware of your social douchiness.</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Wearables like Google glasses have given rise to “social douchiness”, meaning that people become arrogant, self-absorbed assholes that have problems with normal social interactions. We propose an alternative wearable that helps you look inward and watch out for your potential “douchiness”.</p>
					<p>No.2 can be easily attached to your clothes and by monitoring your conversation with another person, provide you feedback through vibrations so that you know “ I’ve been talking too much and might look full of myself. It’s time to shut up.”</p>

						<h3><span>No 3.</span> Wear it out. Show it off.</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Whatever we wear is a fashion statement. Think about the traditional wearables, like a piece of clothes. We wear them not just because of functional reasons. Sometimes we even wear clothes that are neither warm nor comfortable, just to complete “the look”. We don’t wear things only for ourselves; we wear things for other people to see. </p>
					<p>Why does a wearable have to be “functional”? Or who says “showing off” can’t be a valid function? No.3 is a badge that you can either wear or attach to your backpack. It broadcasts your facebook likes or number of retweets based on your customization. Yes it does nothing but showing off your social popularity.</p>

						<h3><span>No 4.</span> Find “Zen” in Killing Time</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Maintaining our physical and mental well-being is an important task in our life but it’s not always about tracking data and achieving goals. The future of healthcare wearable will speak a non-verbal language: instead of showing you numbers, it hugs your body through a sensual interface, soothing your nerves and bringing you peace of mind.</p>
					<p>No. 4 detects your stress and reminds you to meditate. It forms bubbles on its surface much like a bubble wrap. Keep pressing the bubbles until your stress is relieved. You can also activate the bubbles directly when you have some time to kill. Who doesn’t like poking bubbles?</p>

						<h3><span>No 5.</span> Temporary wearable for temporary need.</h3>
					</header>
					<p>We wear things for temporary needs: think about bondage, maxi pad, and contact lenses. We don’t carry them all the time, but when the time comes, they can be most helpful. They’re disposable, so they don’t require constant attention from us. They just do the work, and when their mission is fulfilled, or their term of validity is over, they go away.</p>
					<p>Expresso Express  is a small sticker that you stick to your temple when you feel drowsy. It brings you instant mental clarity just like a shot of Expresso.</p>
