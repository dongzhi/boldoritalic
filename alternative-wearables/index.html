						<h3>Asking Why</h3>
					</header>
					<p>What is a "wearable"? You might be thinking of smart watches, wristbands and google glass. Altogether they painted a perfect future for us, where everything is being tracked and our human abilities greatly enhanced. This singular future picture somehow creates aesthetic fatigue, making us question if there can be other variations to the story.</p>

<p>When can we treat wearables just like the other "wearables" in our life? We don't wear the same clothes everyday, instead we choose what to wear based on specific needs and contexts. So maybe it doesn't make sense to design the "silver bullet wearable" that requires us to wear 24/7 and works perfectly under every circumstance.</p>

<p>In <i>Alternative Wearables - A Design Fiction</i>, we present to you five fictional concepts / scenarios for future wearables. We want to call attention to what a wearable is, what it can be, and our relationship with it.</p>

						<h3><span>No 1.</span> "Dumb" is the new black.</h3>
						<div class="title">A switch that makes other smart devices "dumb".</div>
					</header>
					<p>We've heard about the wearable that makes a dumb thing smart. But what happens when everything is smart? When there're more attention grabbers and more risk of losing your privacy to hidden tracking devices?</p>
					<p>We designed a ring that "dumbifies" all smart devices within 3 feet around you by a simple switch. Enjoy your "offline" time, until you're ready to go "online" again.</p>

						<h3><span>No 2.</span> Be aware of your social douchiness.</h3>
						<div class="title">A social personality indicator that keeps you humble.</div>
					</header>
					<p>Wearables like Google glass have given rise to "social douchiness", meaning that people become arrogant, self-absorbed assholes that have problems with normal social interactions. We designed a humble wearable that helps you look inward and watch out for your potential "douchiness".</p>
					<p>It easily clicks to your clothes and monitors your conversation with another person. It provides you feedback through vibrations so that you know "I've been talking too much and might look full of myself. It's time to shut up." It's perfect for interviews, first date, and other occasions where you care about how your personality come through.</p>

						<h3><span>No 3.</span> Wear it out. Show it off.</h3>
						<div class="title">A statement badge that broadcasts your social popularity.</div>
					</header>
					<p>Whatever we wear is a fashion statement. Think about the traditional wearables, like clothes, or jewelry. We don't wear things only for ourselves; we wear things for other people to see.</p>
					<p>Who says "showing off" can't be a valid function? We designed the ultimate show-off:  a badge that broadcasts in real time your facebook likes or number of retweets based on your customization. What's wrong with showing off your social popularity?</p>

						<h3><span>No 4.</span> The non-verbal wearable.</h3>
						<div class="title">A bubble-wrap wristband that helps you destress.</div>
					</header>
					<p>Maintaining our physical and mental well-being is not always about tracking/displaying data and achieving goals. We designed a wristband that speaks a non-verbal language: instead of showing you numbers, it hugs your body through a sensual interface, soothing your nerves and bringing you peace of mind.</p>
					<p>It detects your stress and forms bubbles on its surface much like a bubble wrap. Keep pressing the bubbles until your stress is relieved. Or just play with it when you have some time to kill. Who doesn't like poking bubbles?</p>

						<h3><span>No 5.</span> Temporary wearable for temporary need.</h3>
						<div class="title">A sticker designed to go away.</div>
					</header>
					<p>We wear things for temporary needs: think about bondage, maxi pad, and contact lenses. They're disposable, so they don't require constant attention from us. They just do the work, and when their mission is fulfilled, or their term of validity is over, they go away.</p>
					<p>We designed a disposable wearable that you can stick to your temple when you feel drowsy. It brings you instant mental clarity just like a shot of Expresso. And when you feel better, just throw it away.</p>
